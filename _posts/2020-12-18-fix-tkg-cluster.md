Newer versions of ESXI (6.7U3+) can run [VMware's Tanzu Kubernetes Grid](https://tanzu.vmware.com/kubernetes-grid). I don't run ESXI HA at home, so unfortunately I don't get to take advantage of some shiny features, but it does some important stuff which is why it's the K8S I run at home:

- PVs are ESXI VMDKs, and can be placed on an iSCSI target (!)
  - You even get to see your PVs in VCSA
- It comes with a nifty CLI tool and some OVAs for load balancers and Kubernetes nodes
  - `tkg scale cluster foo --worker-machine-count=3` and it will do the thing

So, scale I did. But I realized I entered the `-c` flag instead, which gave me 3 control plane nodes instead of 3 workers. I thought my CTRL-C was fast, but we find ourselves here:

```
Â± % tkg get cluster
 NAME    NAMESPACE  STATUS         CONTROLPLANE  WORKERS  KUBERNETES        ROLES
 hubble  default    createStalled  0/1           0/0      v1.19.1+vmware.2  <none>
```

Yikes! `kubectl cluster-info` also times out. Mercifully we get to set an SSH keypair during initial cluster setup, so we can go check the master:

No `kubelet` on 6443. How about the logs?

The TKG nodes don't use Docker, but [containerd](https://containerd.io/) as their CRI directly. Digging in:

```

I don't know much about ctr, but have found out that a container does not necessarily have to be running. You probably want to look at tasks:

```
root [ ~ ]# ctr t ls

Unfortunately, I didn't finish this blogpost when I first sat down to do so and I didn't save scrollback. Sorry about that! However, the next few revelations were had by:

- `ctr t attach` to some running tasks. You may see some logs.
- The PIDs in the task column can be queried using `ps`. Find the one associated with `kube-apiserver`.
- From there, I was able to get logs saying `etcd` is unavailable.

K8S uses `etcd` to basically store all of its data. Corruption here could mean that your workloads and/or their configs can be lost. Generally, `etcdctl` is installed on Kube worker boxes but it doesn't come loaded in VMware's OVAs, so off we go to download it. You can find your `cert`, `cacert`, and `key` inside `/etc/kubernetes/pki`:

```
$ curl -OL https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/releases/download/v3.4.14/etcd-v3.4.14-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf etcd-v3.4.14-linux-amd64.tar.gz
$ cd etcd-v3.4.14-linux-amd64
$ ./etcdctl --endpoints=https://localhost:2379 --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.key member list
{"level":"warn","ts":"2020-12-12T01:32:24.220Z","caller":"clientv3/retry_interceptor.go:62","msg":"retrying of unary invoker failed","target":"endpoint://client-eafb9d39-0cf3-4b02-8c80-ba5a89582354/localhost:2379","attempt":0,"error":"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = latest balancer error: all SubConns are in TransientFailure, latest connection error: connection error: desc = \"transport: Error while dialing dial tcp 127.0.0.1:2379: connect: connection refused\""}
Error: context deadline exceeded
```

Looks like etcd isn't up at all. 

At this point, it became a little clearer. Aborting during control plane scaling is very dangerous, as we ended up having _only two_ etcd nodes running. [The official docs](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.3.12/faq/#:~:text=Why%20an%20odd%20number%20of,of%20nodes%20necessary%20for%20quorum.) recommend always running an odd number of nodes to aid with quorum. Using the same technique above, we were able to tail some logs from the etcd containers. Due to the aforementioned scrollback issue I can't show the logs: but etcd failed to reach quorum.

So, now there's a complete overview:

- We stopped when deploying another controlplane node
- `kube-apiserver` can't go up because `etcd` is down
- `etcd` can't go up because of quorum issues and missing members (presumably from the 3 total requested controlplane nodes?)

### How do we fix it?

Begin by nuking all of your controlplane nodes except for one. **Keep your original master** if you can, presumably the new `etcd` replicas did not sync and you want to minimize the chance of data loss. Then, find the `etcd` manifest and add `--force-new cluster` to the `etcd` args:

`vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - command:
    - etcd
    - --force-new-cluster
    - --cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt
    # ...
```

Save and bounce all the `etcd` containers, wait a min, then try to start kubelet:

```
$ ctr c ls | grep etc | awk '{print $1}' | xargs -I {} ctr c rm {}
$ systemctl restart kubelet
```

If things don't come back to life restart the machine and let init bring everything else back up. If all is well, `kubectl cluster-info` should work again! Let's check that `etcd` health:

```
$ ./etcdctl --endpoints=https://localhost:2379 --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/peer.key member list
82ea945b499897fe, started, hubble-control-plane-26gpw, https://10.0.5.155:2380, https://10.0.5.155:2379, false
```

Great! But we're not done yet; if you want to run the cluster with multiple control planes we are going to need to remove the `--force-new-cluster` flag. Edit it and kill all of your etcd pods (or reboot the master again). Everything should come back up as expected.

### Bonus: DHCP troubles

During the initial install, you can specify `--vsphere-controlplane-endpoint-ip`, which according to the docs is a static IP for your master:

```
If you are deploying Tanzu Kubernetes clusters to vSphere, each cluster requires one static virtual IP address to provide a stable endpoint for Kubernetes. Make sure that this IP address is not in the DHCP range, but is in the same subnet as the DHCP range. For more information, see Load Balancers for vSphere.
```

This is fine, but there are some issues with the implementation:
- `/etc/sysconfig/network` and friends are blank -- so there's no static IP definition on boot.
- The VM if placed in the subnet will get an IP from DHCP
- **The manifests** will now reference the DHCP IP!

For a headache free install, I recommend waiting for `tkg` to put up the control plane, then stopping it in VCSA and quickly adding a static lease for the same IP provided to `--vsphere-controlplane-endpoint-ip`. It will save you a ton of headaches.
