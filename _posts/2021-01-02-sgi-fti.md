The latest release of sgug-rse brought us launchers for RSE apps in the standard icon catalog. This was relatively easy to set up by wrapping the `update-desktop-database` scripts to copy stuff into the catalog directory for IRIX. With a placeholder icon set, it looks like this:

The next step is to get some _actual_ icons in. Let's get started!

#### What are SGI icons?

`*.fti` files are SGI's vector graphics format. IRIX 5.1 (1993) was the debut of the Indigo Magic Desktop -- so if you're wondering why they didn't use SVGs, it's because this was a whole 5 years before the 1998 SVG standard was developed. Here are some docs on the FTI standard and use with the SGI desktop:

- [Retrogeeks SGI developer reference](http://retrogeeks.org/sgi_bookshelves/SGI_Developer/books/IIDsktp_IG/sgi_html/ch11.html)
- [AquaPhoenix's FTI specification](https://www.aquaphoenix.com/software/ftieditor/page6.html)
- [AquaPhoenix's FTI Editor (jar)](https://www.aquaphoenix.com/software/ftieditor/ftiEditor.jar)

Let's crack one of these files open:

```
#Path 0
color(7);
bgnpolygon();
vertex(8.051858,44.963826);
vertex(8.140266,46.948369);
vertex(9.011796,49.985860);
vertex(10.550670,53.866927);
# ... more vertices
endoutlinepolygon(12);
```

You may recognize that directives such as `bgnpolygon` [match IRIS GL functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/opengl/opengl-functions-and-their-iris-gl-equivalents)!

```
$ grep -rni 'bgnpolygon' /usr/include/
/usr/include/gl/dlproto.h:313:extern void       gl_i_bgnpolygon( void );
/usr/include/gl/dlproto.h:314:extern void       gl_c_bgnpolygon( void );
/usr/include/gl/gl.h:1017:extern void     bgnpolygon( void );
```

`color(7)` corresponds to plain white. According to the specs linked above, valid values for the colors range from 0-15 for primary colors and -16 to -255 for extended colors. Below is a screenshot showing IconSmith and FTI editor's palettes:

At first I wrote 0-15 in BIN on some paper and tried to see if there was some clever scheme to use only 8 bits (e.g. `rrrggbbb`) to encode the color, but was unsuccessful. I searched endlessly for a color palette. I looked at IRIS GL headers and did find consts for each one of the 15 primary colors. I saw some really old example code online where people built color tables, but still don't really understand how this works (can someone please explain?). Only after a considerable amount of time playing with the FTI editor I began to notice:

- The leftmost vertical row of extended colors causes the index to jump by `16`
- Moving right within a row is `(-y * 16) + x`
- Each column sort of looks like the color from the row of originals
- The white column specifically like watered down versions of the colors before the initial white tile

After what was days of struggling I finally got it: each color from the 15 initial ones is mixed with every other by doing `avg(r, r'), avg(g, g'), avg(b, b')`. The `x` offset previously mentioned corresponds to the iteration offset in the primary color table. The colormap can then be generated with this Python code:

```python
# Color
PRIMARY_COLORS = [
  (0, 0, 0),
  (255, 0, 0),
  (0, 255, 0),
  (255, 255, 0),
  (0, 0, 255),
  (255, 0, 255),
  (0, 255, 255),
  (255, 255, 255),
  (85, 85, 85),
  (198, 113, 113),
  (113, 198, 113),
  (142, 142, 56),
  (113, 113, 198),
  (142, 56, 142),
  (56, 142, 142),
  (170, 170, 170)
]

color_map = {}

for i, (r, g, b) in enumerate(PRIMARY_COLORS):
  color_map[i] = (r, g, b)
  base = -16 * i

  # zip keeps going until one collection runs out
  for j, (rm, gm, bm) in zip(range(0, i), PRIMARY_COLORS):
    mixed_index = base - j
    color_map[mixed_index] = (
      (r + rm) / 2,
      (g + gm) / 2,
      (b + bm) / 2
    )
```

So: if we have the vertices for a given path we can choose to make a line/path or polygon, and specify a stroke or fill, now in colors we understand.

#### XDG Desktop Enties

`/usr/sgug/share/applications` includes [XDG Desktop Menu](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/menu-spec-latest.html) formatted application entries that ship with each package for inclusion into your DM's launcher. RSE ships with a script to parse these and generate small scripts in the catalog directory that exec `Exec`. 

For example `ddd.desktop`:

```
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=Data Display Debugger
Comment=Graphical debugger frontend
Comment[fr]=Interface graphique pour débogueur
Exec=ddd
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Icon=ddd
Categories=Development;
```

Icons live in `/usr/sgug/share/icons`. We need vector icons. Inconveniently the majority are PNGs, but most projects have an SVG icon (either official or fanfic) that is easily found online. Some even ship with packages we already have:

```
$ find /usr/sgug/share/icons -iname 'ddd*' -type f
/usr/sgug/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/ddd.png

$ tree /usr/sgug/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/
hicolor/scalable/apps/
|-- barrier.svg
|-- emacs.svg
|-- filled-xterm.svg
|-- mini.xterm.svg
|-- pidgin.svg
|-- xterm-color.svg
`-- xterm.svg
```

#### Make FTI out of SVG?

Most of the heavy lifting is done by the `<path>` [line commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/d). Quoting the docs:

```
> SVG defines 6 types of path commands, for a total of 20 commands:
>     MoveTo: M, m
>     LineTo: L, l, H, h, V, v
>     Cubic Bézier Curve: C, c, S, s
>     Quadratic Bézier Curve: Q, q, T, t
>     Elliptical Arc Curve: A, a
>     ClosePath: Z, z
```

FTI has support for arcs, but trying to map a path from SVG would require an operator who [understands this link better](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/734076/how-to-best-approximate-a-geometrical-arc-with-a-bezier-curve). I think we can fake it though: if you keep adding sides to a polygon it will slowly start to resemble a circle. Get 100 or so points from each SVG path and your curves will probably look fine (especially icon sized).

Python has a great package for parsing SVG: [svg.path](https://pypi.org/project/svg.path):

> All of these objects have a .point() function which will return the coordinates of a point on the path, where the point is given as a floating point value where 0.0 is the start of the path and 1.0 is end.

Using Python's XML xpath thing and our shiny new tool, I was able to produce this FTI icon from [this Pidgin svg](https://gist.github.com/mach-kernel/504c75ede46cb2bf81f6f7bcfe773a42)! The first one shows 10 samples, then 50, 100, and 1000 (the last one is especially fun because it's all the overlapping yellow vertex circles from the editor!):
