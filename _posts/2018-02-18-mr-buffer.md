The Apple IIgs came out on September 15, 1986. It featured an absolutely earth-shattering 2.8 MHz WDC 65816 CPU (the same one that powered the SNES and other similar computers of that era, a 16-bit CPU with 24-bit addressing), 256k or 1MB RAM (upgradable to 8 MB), and an Ensoniq 8-bit stereo synth (which was a welcome upgrade from the bit-speaker of the Apple II family). The original Apple II family was built around the 6502 (8 bit, 16-bit addressing): it was designed to use console-interactive applications via ProDOS, or games that had their own custom rendering stacks built from scratch. In contrast, GS shipped with GS/OS, an operating system built to use the new computer's more powerful hardware. Booting the GS off of its system disk brought you to a GUI and not a console prompt. It would be misleading to omit mention of the [Apple built GUI](http://toastytech.com/guis/a2desk.html) for the Apple II family, however this compared to GS/OS is more of an afterthought. This was the first consumer-first computer that Apple shipped with _intent_ to provide a graphical user experience (other than the Lisa, but that computer was primarily marketed to businesses) to the everyman. This article is going to walk through, start to finish, how to build a text editor for this machine.
